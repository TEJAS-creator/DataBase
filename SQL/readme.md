## 📖 About

This repository contains a **single `.sql` file** that takes you from *Hello World* to complex joins and database management.

Instead of dry business data, we use a dataset featuring **Attack on Titan**, **Studio Ghibli**, **Violet Evergarden**, and more. This makes understanding relationships (like **Studios** vs **Anime**) intuitive and visual.

### Why this guide?

- ✅ **Zero Fluff** – Short theory followed immediately by code  
- 📄 **One File** – Everything is inside `anime_course.sql`  
- 🌍 **Universal SQL** – Works with SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server
